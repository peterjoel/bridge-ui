## POA Bridge UI app
A Cross-chain bridge provides interoperability between any Ethereum-compatible network such as Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum Classic, Ubiq, Expanse, POA Network, Rootstock, and many others.<br/>
This Bridge-UI is an app which runs on multiple computers with two contracts on both sides of the bridge. As an example, on the left side of the bridge is POA Network. The app listens to events from the Home Bridge contract. On the right side of the bridge is Ethereum Foundation. In congruence with the communicating smart contracts and the Bridge-UI Dapp, ERC20 tokens are created corresponding to these events mapped 1:1.<br/>
The contract on the right side of the bridge accepts transactions signed by authorities of the POA consensus. A subset of validators on POA Network runs the bridge software. If you trust authorities of the POA Network, then you inherit this trust into the bridge, i.e. the assets are transferred in a trustless manner.<br/>

Using the current implementation of Bridges-UI, a user can tokenize their native coin of an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) network into ERC20 representation token on another EVM compatible network. 
Security considerations:
In order to provide better decentralization of the bridges, a user can increase the number of required signatures and expand the number of validators. To increase security, block confirmations should be increased to protect against double spending attacks.
POA smart contracts allows maintainers of the bridges to 
- Upgrade smart contracts by fixing potential security vulnerabilities in a smart contract with multisig contract
- Add validators
- Remove validators
- Set required number of signatures from validators
- Set daily limit of deposits on Home Network(left side) for native coin deposits(POA)
- Set max limit per transaction for deposits on Home Network(left side) for native coin deposits(POA)
- Set daily limit of withdrawals on Foreign Network(right side) for ERC20/ERC677 token transfers(POA20)
- Set max limit per transaction for deposits on Foreign Network(right side) for ERC20/ERC677 token transfers(POA20)
- Storing Home Deposits in Home Bridge contract
- Minting on Deposits of ERC20 compatible token on Foreign Network by validators
- Burning on Withdrawals of ERC20 compatible token on Foreign Network by validators

Bridge UI  features:
- Show daily limits in both networks
- Display all events in both networks
- Filter events from specific block number on both sides
- Find corresponding event on different sides of the network
- Submit a transaction from Home to Foreign network
- Submit a transaction from Foreign to Home network

## Bridge UI
Bridge UI allows users to explore all cross chain transactions that are happening. Users can submit a transaction on both sides of the networks. 

#### From Home to Foreign Network transaction:
To tokenize native POA coins a user must complete the following:
- Specify the amount
- Click the arrow -> send button
- Confirm transaction via MetaMask
- The address that you use to send from, the same address will be used to receive the token on a Foreign chain
The amount sent must be within the daily limits provided by the contracts. When the transaction is validated, the user should see the Deposit event on the Home Network (left side - POA Network). After some time, Validators submit signatures emitting SignedForDeposit event to the Foreign Network. Once the required number of signatures is reached, a Deposit event is emitted on the Foreign Network. Hence, an equivalent amount of ERC20 tokens are minted on the Foreign Network with the corresponding depost address. 

#### From Foreign to Home Network transaction:
To burn and send back to Home Network (ERC20 to POA20):
- Specify an Amount
- Click the switch button and click the <- arrow button to send
- Confirm transaction on MetaMask
- The address that you use to send from, the same address will be used to receive the coin on a Home chain

The amount sent must be within the daily limits provided by the contracts. When the transaction is validated, the user should expect to see a Withdrawal Event on the Foreign Network (right-side - Ethereum Foundation). After some time, Validators submit signatures emitting SignedForWithdrawal event to the Foreign Network. Once the required number of signatures is reached, CollectedSignatures event is emitted on the Foreign Network. The ERC20 tokens are burned on the Foreign Network. This process generates a signed message which Validators submit on the Home Network. The user automatically receives their Native POA Coin.

# Responsibilities and roles of the bridge:
- Administrator Role(representation of a multisig contract):
  - add/remove validators
  - set daily limits on both bridges
  - set maximum per transaction limit on both bridges
  - upgrade contracts in case of vulnerability
  - set minimum required signatures from validators in order to relay a user's transaction
- Validator Role :
  - provide 100% uptime to relay transactions
  - listen for Deposit events on Home bridge to mint erc20 token on Foreign bridge
  - listen for Withdraw events on Foreign bridge to unlock funds on Home Bridge
- User role:
  - sends POA coins to Home bridge in order to receive ERC20 token on Foreign Bridge using the same address to send/receive
  - sends ERC20 POA20 token on Foreign Bridge in order to receive POA coins on Home Bridge using the same address to send/receive

## Preparation for using the UI App
0. Create empty folder where you will be setting up your bridge. In the following example lets call it `sokol-kovan-bridge`
Folder structure:
```bash
.
└── sokol-kovan-bridge
    ├── ForeignBridge_bytecode.bin
    ├── HomeBridge_bytecode.bin
    ├── bridge-ui
    ├── config.toml
    ├── db.toml
    ├── parity-bridge
    ├── kovan-node
    ├── sokol-node
    └── poa-parity-bridge-contracts
```
1. Install parity (Current setup was tested against parity 1.9.3)
2. Setup Home Network node. In this example, we will use `sokol-node` folder
Example: POA-Sokol:
  * Download Sokol spec.json file from [here](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-chain-spec/blob/sokol/spec.json)
  * Download Sokol bootnodes.txt file from [here](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-chain-spec/blob/sokol/bootnodes.txt)
  * Create sokol.toml file
```bash
# Sokol
[parity]
chain = "spec.json" # For Sokol https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-chain-spec/blob/sokol/spec.json
base_path = "sokol-datadir" #folder where the blockchain will be synced and keys stored
[network]
port = 30305
discovery=true
reserved_peers = "./bootnodes.txt" #bootnodes file For Sokol: https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-chain-spec/blob/sokol/bootnodes.txt
[rpc]
cors = ["all"]
interface = "all"
hosts = ["all"]
port = 8545 # port needed for truffle.js config 
apis = ["web3", "eth", "net", "parity", "rpc", "secretstore", "traces"]
[websockets]
disable = false
port = 8546 # port for WS connection which you should provide in .env later as REACT_APP_HOME_WEB_SOCKETS_PARITY_URL
interface = "all"
origins = ["all"]
apis = ["web3", "eth", "net", "parity", "rpc", "secretstore", "pubsub"]
hosts = ["all"]
[account]
unlock = ["0xETH_ACCOUNT_VALIDATOR_SOKOL"] # Please provide your OWN ETH public Key here
password = ["parity_password"] # Name of the file containing the password for the key above

```
  * from the config above you have to create `keys` folder in: `sokol-datadir/keys/Sokol` and insert your JSON keystore `0xETH_ACCOUNT_VALIDATOR_SOKOL` eth key
  * create `parity_password` file and store password for your public key in plaintext format
  * run your Home(sokol) node
```bash
parity --config sokol.toml --nat=none --no-ui
```

3. Get POA Bridge contracts:
  * `git clone https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-parity-bridge-contracts.git`
  * `cd poa-parity-bridge-contracts && npm install`
  * open `truffle.js` file and make sure you add the following your home network config:
```js
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "localhost",
      port: 7545,
      network_id: "*" // Match any network id
    },
    home: {
      host: "localhost",
      port: "8545", // check your sokol.toml [rpc] port section
      network_id: "*",
      gas: 4700000,
      gasPrice: 1000000000
    }
  }
};
```
  * Make sure your parity Home(sokol) node is fully synced by this step
  * Get free Sokol Coins from the [sokol-faucet](https://faucet-sokol.herokuapp.com/)
  * Run the deployment script with following parameters:
```bash
VALIDATORS="0xETH_ACCOUNT_VALIDATOR_SOKOL 0xVALIDATOR_2" REQUIRED_NUMBER_OF_VALIDATORS=1 HOME_LIMIT=1000000000000000000 MAX_AMOUNT_PER_TX=100000000000000000 PROXY_OWNER="YOUR_UNLOCKED_PARITY_ACCOUNT" NETWORK=home npm run deploy
```
```ruby
Explanation of parameters:
VALIDATORS - list of validators who can validate bridge transactions
REQUIRED_NUMBER_OF_VALIDATORS - how many signatures will be required in order to relay a tx
HOME_LIMIT - daily limit in Wei (in the example above is 1 eth)
MAX_AMOUNT_PER_TX - max amount per transaction in Wei(in the example above is 0.1 eth)
PROXY_OWNER - an account which should be unlocked and which will hold the `Administrator` role
NETWORK - reads truffle.js network
```
  * Wait when deployment is done
  * when the deployment is finished you will have something like this: 
```js
all is done
  validators: 0xb8988b690910913c97a090c3a6f80fad8b3a4683
  Owner: 0xb8988b690910913c97a090c3a6f80fad8b3a4683
  Foreign Bridge: 0xdceabcfa4ffa7765913cd002c67f123127e2f762
  Home Bridge: 0x030caae2549fc2584879c8713d3e98d1ab615235
  POA20: 0x3ac82ca0ab3d78e131cc563c72716d11fc3795f8
```
  * Copy only `Home Bridge:` line and save it somewhere else. You will also need block number of contract deployment, use https://sokol-explorer.poa.network to find it by contract address


4. Setup Foreign Network node.
I will be using Kovan for this example in the folder `kovan-node`
  * prepare kovan.toml
```bash
# Kovan
[parity]
chain = "kovan" # Parity comes in with built-in kovan spec file
base_path = "kovan-datadir" #folder where the blockchain will be synced and keys stored
[network]
port = 30308 # make sure it's different from sokol.toml network port
discovery=true
[rpc]
cors = ["all"]
interface = "all"
hosts = ["all"]
port = 8591 # port needed for truffle.js config. Please make sure it's different from sokol.toml
apis = ["web3", "eth", "net", "parity", "rpc", "secretstore", "traces"]
[websockets]
disable = false
port = 8541 # port for WS connection which you should provide in .env later as REACT_APP_FOREGIGN_WEB_SOCKETS_PARITY_URL
interface = "all"
origins = ["all"]
apis = ["web3", "eth", "net", "parity", "rpc", "secretstore", "pubsub"]
hosts = ["all"]
[account]
unlock = ["0xETH_ACCOUNT_VALIDATOR_KOVAN"] # Please provide your OWN ETH public Key here for Validator
password = ["parity_password"] # Name of the file containing the password for the key above

```
* from the config above you have to create `keys` folder in: `kovan-datadir/keys/kovan` and insert your JSON keystore `0xETH_ACCOUNT_VALIDATOR_KOVAN` eth key that will be used for validation of the bridge
* create `parity_password` file and store password for your public key in plaintext format
* run your Foreign(Kovan) node
```bash
parity --config kovan.toml --nat=none --no-ui
```
* Please make sure you are fully synced Foreign(kovan) network chain by this step
* Get free Kovan Coins from the [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet) or [Iracus faucet](https://github.com/kovan-testnet/faucet)
* Go back to your `poa-parity-bridge-contracts` folder where you previosly used for Home contracts deployment
* open `truffle.js` file and make sure you add the following your home network config:
```js
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "localhost",
      port: 7545,
      network_id: "*" // Match any network id
    },
    home: {
      host: "localhost",
      port: "8545", // check your sokol.toml [rpc] port section
      network_id: "*",
      gas: 4700000,
      gasPrice: 1000000000
    },
    foreign: {
      host: "localhost",
      port: "8591", // check your kovan.toml [rpc] port section
      network_id: "*",
      gas: 4700000,
      gasPrice: 1000000000
    }
  }
};
```
  * Run the deployment script with following parameters:
```bash
VALIDATORS="0xVALIDATOR_1 0xVALIDATOR_2" REQUIRED_NUMBER_OF_VALIDATORS=1 FOREIGN_LIMIT=1000000000000000000 MAX_AMOUNT_PER_TX=100000000000000000 NETWORK=foreign npm run deploy
```
  * Wait when deployment is done
  * when the deployment is finished you will have something like this: 
```js
all is done
  validators: 0xb8988b690910913c97a090c3a6f80fad8b3a4683
  Owner: 0xb8988b690910913c97a090c3a6f80fad8b3a4683
  Foreign Bridge: 0xd586e9f2da9f496bfc28c9092166ea52c8024a5d
  Home Bridge: 0x6263f1fbff2dc1e8ed5e52168e9760a3613b1877
  POA20: 0x064cafec541a4faf9b7c4ffe4257d50cf0775df5
```
  * Copy only `Foreign Bridge: ...` line and save it somewhere else. You will also need block number of contract deployment, use https://kovan.etherscan.io to find it by contract address

5. Install parity-bridge binary

requires `rust` and `cargo`: [installation instructions.](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)

requires `solc` to be in `$PATH`: [installation instructions.](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/installing-solidity.html)

assuming you've cloned the bridge (`git clone https://github.com/poanetwork/parity-bridge.git`)
and are in the project directory (`cd parity-bridge`) run:

```
cargo build -p bridge-cli --release
```
6. Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
7. Create `HomeBridge_bytecode.bin` with the following command:
```bash
cat sokol-kovan-bridge/poa-parity-bridge-contracts/build/contracts/HomeBridge.json | jq '.bytecode' -r | cut -c 3- > HomeBridge_bytecode.bin
```
8. Create `ForeignBridge_bytecode.bin` with the following command:
```bash
cat sokol-kovan-bridge/poa-parity-bridge-contracts/build/contracts/ForeignBridge.json | jq '.bytecode' -r | cut -c 3- > ForeignBridge_bytecode.bin
```
9. Create `config.toml` file
```yaml
estimated_gas_cost_of_withdraw = 0
[home]
#account which you specified as validator on Home network
account = "0xETH_ACCOUNT_VALIDATOR_SOKOL" 
#Full  IPC path to your HOME node
ipc = "/Users/USERNAME/sokol-kovan-bridge/sokol-node/sokol-datadir/jsonrpc.ipc"
# How many block confirmation to wait to send a tx
required_confirmations = 0

[home.contract]

bin = "HomeBridge_bytecode.bin"

[foreign]
account = "0xETH_ACCOUNT_VALIDATOR_KOVAN"
ipc = "/Users/USERNAME/sokol-kovan-bridge/kovan-node/kovan-datadir/jsonrpc.ipc"
required_confirmations = 0

[foreign.contract]
bin = "ForeignBridge_bytecode.bin"

[authorities]
accounts = [
  "0xETH_ACCOUNT_VALIDATOR_SOKOL",
  "0xETH_ACCOUNT_VALIDATOR_KOVAN"
]
required_signatures = 1

[transactions]
home_deploy = { gas = 3000000 }
foreign_deploy = { gas = 3000000 }
deposit_relay = { gas = 3000000 }
withdraw_relay = { gas = 3000000 }
withdraw_confirm = { gas = 3000000 }
```
10. Create db.toml file
```yaml
home_contract_address = "0x030caae2549fc2584879c8713d3e98d1ab615235" #YOUR HOME CONTRACT ADDRESS THAT YOU DEPLOYED IN STEP#3 
foreign_contract_address = "0xd586e9f2da9f496bfc28c9092166ea52c8024a5d" #YOUR FOREIGN CONTRACT ADDRESS THAT YOU DEPLOYED IN STEP#4
home_deploy = 1400663 # block number at which the contract was created for home contract
foreign_deploy = 6342830 # block number at which the contract was created for foreign contract
checked_deposit_relay = 1400663 # last checked deposits events on Home network
checked_withdraw_relay = 6342830 # last checked withdraw events on Foreign network
checked_withdraw_confirm = 6342830 # last checked withdraw events on Foreign network
```
11. At this step your folder structure should look like this
```bash
.
└── sokol-kovan-bridge
    ├── ForeignBridge_bytecode.bin
    ├── HomeBridge_bytecode.bin
    ├── config.toml
    ├── db.toml
    ├── parity-bridge
    ├── kovan-node
    ├── sokol-node
    └── poa-parity-bridge-contracts
```
12. Run the bridge app:
```
env RUST_LOG=info ./parity-bridge/target/release/bridge --config config.toml --database db.toml
```

If everything went well, you should see some logs from the  bridge:
```bash
INFO:bridge: Parsing cli arguments
INFO:bridge: Loading config
INFO:bridge: Starting event loop
